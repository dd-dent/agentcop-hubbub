# Grimoire of Hubbub ⓿

Welcome, wayfarer.  
This hidden cellar stores the **narrative sinew** of the repo—motifs, myths, and personality sketches that help humans (and polite agents) map the code-labyrinth.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [`src.md`](src.md) | Metaphoric dossiers for every source component (to be expanded by agents). |

> **Protocol:**  
> 1. Before touching code, the agent skims the relevant grimoire page.  
> 2. After completing a task, the agent *extends or amends* the grimoire to reflect new reality.  
> 3. Human authors may annotate freely—creativity encouraged, but keep it civil.

*(If this MANIFEST disappears, the pipes groan and the lioness stirs.  You have been warned.)*
